# Electronic-Accompaniment-Generation

Team Members:
Matthew Avallone
Anish Malhotra

Summary:
The goal of this project is given a melody for a song, generate an accompaniment for it. The approach is to phrase this as a machine translation problem, where the melody gets passed through an encoder-decoder LSTM neural network that encodes an input matrix of notes and decodes an output matrix of notes.
